# MNIST Digit Classification

## Deep Learning Model

This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is divided into training and test sets, with corresponding labels for each image.
